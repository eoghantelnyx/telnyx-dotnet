The official Telnyx library, supporting .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Core 1.0+, and .NET Framework 4.5+

## Documentation

See the [.NET API docs](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/overview?lang=dotnet).

## Installation

### Install Telnyx.net via NuGet

From the command line:

	nuget install Telnyx.net

From Package Manager:

	PM> Install-Package Telnyx.net

From within Visual Studio:

1. Open the Solution Explorer.
2. Right-click on a project within your solution.
3. Click on *Manage NuGet Packages...*
4. Click on the *Browse* tab and search for "Telnyx.net".
5. Click on the Telnyx.net package, select the appropriate version in the right-tab and click *Install*.

### Set the API Key for your project

You can configure the Telnyx.net package to use your secret API key in one of two ways:

a) In your application initialization, set your API Key (only once during startup):

```csharp
TelnyxConfiguration.SetApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY");
```

b) Pass the API key to [RequestOptions](#requestoptions):

```csharp
var numberReservationsService = new NumberReservationsService();
numberReservationsService.Get("PHONE_NUMBER_ID", new RequestOptions { ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY" });
```

You can obtain your secret API key from the [Auth](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/auth/v2) section oin the Mission Control Portal.

### Xamarin/Mono Developers (Optional)

If you are using Xamarin/Mono, you may want to provide your own `HttpMessageHandler`. You can do so by passing an instance to `TelnyxConfiguration.HttpMessageHandler` on your application's startup.

## Support

* Make sure to review open [issues](https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-dotnet/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-dotnet/pulls) before opening a new issue.
* Feel free to leave a comment or [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) on any existing issues.
* For all other support requests, please [reach out to the Telnyx support team](https://telnyx.com/contact-us).

## Helpful Library Information

### Run Test Project via Docker CLI

In order to run the tests you need to have the telnyx-mock running on your local port. This mock is used to mimic the Telnyx API in order to ensure responses will be correct.

Steps to install and run the telynx-mock can be found here: [readme](https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-mock/blob/master/README.md)

Explicit steps are as follows:

 * Make sure you have docker installed. This can be either windows/mac/linux.
 * Run the docker pull cmd: `docker pull telnyx/telnyx-mock:latest`
 * Verify the image is pulled correctly: `docker images`
 * If you see the image listed, now we can run the image: `docker run -p 12111-12112:12111-12112 telnyx/telnyx-mock`
 * Keep this powershell or cmdline window open and run the TelynxTests project via test runner or dotnet-cli
 * Add your API key to the appsettings file. For NET45+ use `App.config` for `netstandard/netcore use appsettings.json` found in the test project

### Run Telnyx.Example Project with your API Key
 In oder to get the Example project to run properly, you can add your API Key to the `appsettings.json` file similar to above.
 Here you can play around with the console app without requiring the telnyx-mock to run.

 NOTE: This will hit the API directly so be aware of the different operations you are trying as rate limiting applies.

### Request Options

All of the service methods accept an optional `RequestOptions` object. This is used if you want to pass the secret API key on each method.

```csharp
var requestOptions = new RequestOptions();
requestOptions.ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";                        // (optional) set the api key on a per-request basis
```

### Responses

The [`TelnyxResponse`](https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-dotnet/blob/master/src/Telnyx.net/Infrastructure/Public/TelnyxResponse.cs) object is an attribute (with the same name) attached to all entities in Telnyx.net when they are returned from a service call.

**Example: Access the TelnyxResponse**
```csharp
var numberReservationsService = new NumberReservationsService();
NumberReservation reservation = numberReservationsService.Create(...);
TelnyxResponse response = reservation.TelnyxResponse;
```

The information that can be derived from the `TelnyxResponse` is available from the [TelnyxResponse Class](https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-dotnet/blob/master/src/Telnyx.net/Infrastructure/Public/TelnyxResponse.cs).

```csharp
public class TelnyxResponse
{
	// ResponseJson will always tell you the complete json Telnyx returned to Telnyx.net.
	// this will be the same as the ObjectJson when you execute a create/get/delete call.
	// however, if you execute a List() method, the ResponseJson will have the full api result
	// from Telnyx (a phone number list with 10 phone numbers, for example).
	public string ResponseJson { get; set; }

	// when you call a List() method, the object json is the object in the response array that represents
	// the entity. The ResponseJson will be the full array returned from Telnyx on every entity, however,
	// since that was the full response from Telnyx. ObjectJson is always the same as ResponseJson when
	// you are doing a regular create/get/delete, because you are dealing with a single object.
	public string ObjectJson { get; set; }

	// this is the request id of the call. I would recommend logging
	// this and/or saving it to your database. this is very useful when troubleshooting with Telnyx support
	public string RequestId { get; set; }

	// this is the request date and time of the call. I would also recommend logging this and/or
	// saving it to your database, as it tells you when Telnyx processed the request.
	public DateTime RequestDate { get; set; }
}
```

### Pagination

The [`TelnyxList`](https://github.com/thedonmon/telnyx-dotnet/blob/master/src/Telnyx.net/Entities/TelnyxList.cs) object that includes the collection of data as well as pagination properties.

**Example: Access a TelynxList**
```csharp
var numberReservationsService = new NumberReservationsService();
TelnyxList reservationList = numberReservationsService.List(...);
List<NumberReservation> reservationData = reservationList.Data;
PageInfo pages = reservationList.PageInfo;
```

```csharp

    public class TelnyxList<T> : TelnyxEntity, IEnumerable<T>
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets or sets a string describing the object type returned.
        /// </summary>
        public string Object => typeof(T).Name;

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets or sets a list containing the actual response elements, paginated by any request parameters.
        /// </summary>
        public List<T> Data { get; set; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets or sets a value indicating whether whether or not there are more elements available after this set. If <c>false</c>,
        /// this set comprises the end of the list.
        /// </summary>
        public bool HasMore => PageInfo?.HasMore ?? false;

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets or sets the URL for accessing this list.
        /// </summary>
        public string Url => this?.TelnyxResponse?.Url ?? string.Empty;

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets or sets pageinformation from the API Response
        /// </summary>
        public PageInfo PageInfo { get; set; }

    }
```
**Pagination with ListOptions**
```csharp
    public class ListOptions : BaseOptions
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// The size of the page
        /// </summary>
        public int? PageSize { get; set; }

        /// <summary>
        /// The page number to load
        /// </summary>
        public int? PageNumber { get; set; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Set number of pages to get and return as list of entities. Default: null (all pages)
        /// Can page a set amount by specifying the amount of pages to fetch.
        /// If greater than actual pages will just return the total amount of results.
        /// </summary>
        public int? NumberOfPagesToFetch { get; set; }
    }
```

In order to paginate automatically through a list method be sure to setup the corresponding ListOption object.
The NumberOfPagesToFetch is optional but allows the call to gather data from multiple pages. Enter the amount of pages you want
to page through and all the results will be returned in the `TelynxList.Data` property.

*NOTE*: Use any number greater than 1 for the `NumberOfPagesToFetch`.
1 page is just like setting the pagenumber. E.g. NumberOfPagesToFetch = 2 will give you the first page and next page.

**Example:**
```csharp
    var listOptions = new NumberConfigurationsListOptions
                      {
                          Status = NumberConfigStatus.Active,
                          PageNumber = 1,
                          NumberOfPagesToFetch = 3,
                          PageSize = 3

                      };

    var res = await numConfigService.ListPhoneNumbersAsync(listOptions); //if you dont specify a pagenumber, pagination will begin at the first page.
    var phoneNumberConfigurationsList = res.Data;

    //you can access if the endpoint has more data and how many pages are left via the PageInfo object thats returned
    if(res.HasMore){
        var nextPage = res.PageInfo.NextPage;
        var totalPages = res.PageInfo.TotalPages;
            var listOptions = new NumberConfigurationsListOptions
                      {
                          Status = NumberConfigStatus.Active,
                          PageNumber = nextPage,
                          NumberOfPagesToFetch = 3,
                          PageSize = 3

                      };
        res = await numConfigService.ListPhoneNumbersAsync(listOptions);
	}
```
